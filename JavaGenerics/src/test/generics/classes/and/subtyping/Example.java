/*
We can subtype a generic class or interface by extending or implementing it. The relationship between the type
parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and implements
clauses.
For example, ArrayList<E> implements List<E> that extends Collection<E>, so ArrayList<String> is a subtype of
List<String> and List<String> is subtype of Collection<String>.

The subtyping relationship is preserved as long as we donâ€™t change the type argument, below shows an example of
multiple type parameters.
